_This is a minimal fork that simply builds cinny and mounts the frontend assets in a shared volume. TODO: refactor to use a simple http file server for ease of composition_

## Building and Running

### Running pre-compiled

A tarball of pre-compiled version of the app is provided with each [release](https://github.com/ajbura/cinny/releases).
You can serve the application with a webserver of your choosing by simply copying `dist/` directory to the webroot.

### Building from source

> We recommend using a version manager as versions change very quickly. You will likely need to switch
> between multiple Node.js versions based on the needs of different projects you're working on. [NVM on windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#installation--upgrades) on Windows and [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) on Linux/macOS are pretty good choices. Also recommended nodejs version is 16.15.0 LTS.

Execute the following commands to compile the app from its source code:

```sh
npm ci # Installs all dependencies
npm run build # Compiles the app into the dist/ directory
```

You can then copy the files to a webserver's webroot of your choice.

To serve a development version of the app locally for testing, you may also use the command `npm start`.

### Running with Docker

This repository includes a Dockerfile, which builds the application from source and serves it with Nginx on port 80. To
use this locally, you can build the container like so:

```
docker build -t cinny:latest .
```

You can then run the container you've built with a command similar to this:

```
docker run -p 8080:80 cinny:latest
```

This will forward your `localhost` port 8080 to the container's port 80. You can visit the app in your browser by
navigating to `http://localhost:8080`.

Alternatively you can just pull the [DockerHub image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ajbura/cinny) by `docker pull ajbura/cinny`.

### Configuring default Homeserver

To set default Homeserver on login and register page, place a customized [`config.json`](config.json) in webroot of your choice.
